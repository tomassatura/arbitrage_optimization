    "The task is to optimize revenue generation from performing of energy arbitrage. The approach used in this solution will follow maximizing of profit that is given as a difference between revenue and cost. It is assumed that both revenue and cost only arise from settlements on day ahead market, hence neglecting any further incurred costs (e.g. distribution, fees), as well as other CapEx and OpEx costs. The objective function will thus be given by:\n",

In this example, the solution is performed on a set of $$ t \\in \\{0, 1, 2 ..., 23\\} $$ for a single selected day, leading to a computationally inexpensive solution.

Furthermore, the model can be made more realistic by considering physical phenomena such as reaction/ramp-up time, business realities such as other associated costs etc. A solution with higher average gain per day can be obtained by widening the scope of the problem to use the optimization on horizon greater than one day. Some other constraints are often provided regarding scheduling, such as minimum time between charging and discharging, minimum uninterrupted runtime or threshold price over which/under which the system does not buy/sell."
